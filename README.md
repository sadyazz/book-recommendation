# Book Recommendation System

This project is a book recommendation system that provides personalized book suggestions based on user interactions (like/dislike) with previously recommended books. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to predict which books a user is likely to enjoy based on their past feedback.

## Features
- Personalized book recommendations based on user preferences.
- Book descriptions processed using TF-IDF to understand content similarity.
- Machine learning model (Logistic Regression) used to predict the likelihood of a user liking a book.
- Real-time interaction where users can like or dislike books, allowing the system to continuously learn and improve predictions.
